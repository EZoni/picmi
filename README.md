# PICMI & AMI #

The *Particle-In-Cell Modeling Interface* (**PICMI**) and *Accelerator Modeling Interface* (**AMI**) standards establish conventions for the naming and structuring of input files for Particle-In-Cell and particle accelerator simulations.

The actual implementation of the standard can be performed using JSON, Python, FORTRAN or other.

### Current status ###

The existing definitions are just a first pass, to get the ball running. Nothing is set into stone yet...
